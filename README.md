BST and RBT

THIS PROGRAM MUST BE RAN IN PYTHON 3.7!
--
OTHERWISE YOU WILL GET A INPUT BUG ON SEARCH!
--
Open terminal (or command line if you're running Windows) head to the
directory for the unzipped program (Where you unzipped the turn-in file)
You should see main.py and some other python source files.
To run the program simply type:
python main.py

- This assumes you have python installed correctly!

A command-line user interface will guide your through the process of
testing the different algorithms and output the results to a file in
the working directory of the program.
Obviously, python must be installed for this to work correctly.
No external requirements or imports should be required.

All other docs (an excel sheet with all the data collected) as well as
a report .pdf are contained within the docs folder.

PLEASE NOTE:
The excel sheet contains four 'tabs' these can be seen at the bottom of
the window if running in Microsoft Excel.
ALSO NOTE:
My BST algo has a bit of a bad attitude and doesn't play well with the sorted lists.
It maxes out pythons recursion limit, I wasn't able to resolve this issue before the due
date. I expect this to result in deduction of points, I just wanted to make a note so you didn't
think the program ran 'correctly'
Also, RBT doesn't output a sorted list to a file, but BST does output it's tree, and searches correctly.

-- ALL OUTPUT GOES TO 'output/' in the working directory.
